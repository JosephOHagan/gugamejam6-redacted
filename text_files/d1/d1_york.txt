This is special agent comrade York reporting in but please just call me York that’s what everyone else does. 

No progress made on my tracking of the “origami killer” but I did discover a lovely coffee cafe two blocks over from where the VanHalen boy went missing. 

The waitress she... might know more than she’s letting on. I’ll make a few return trips while I evaluate her and decide if I should take her in for questioning.
