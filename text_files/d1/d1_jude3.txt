Someone’s coming after me, I don’t know what I’m gonna do
Someone’s coming after me, I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I didn’t lay a finger on Abel
This Cain really is pulling one over you 

I got this woman she’s killing me alive
I got this woman she’s killing me alive
She berates me for being late
When I’m home just after five

The doctors in the theatre, he really needs your applause
The doctors in the theatre, he really needs your applause
When that curtain call comes baby 
He better not hear you pause

I woke in this world and it don’t make one lick of sense
I woke in this world and it don’t make one lick of sense
The mad hatter’s got his party 
All sitting on a barbed wire fence
