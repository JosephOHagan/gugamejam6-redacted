Hey Kat, have you heard of the ‘The Bechdel Test’ it’s this awesome test for media that originated from a 1985 comic strip. For a movie to pass the test it must have at least two named, female character who talk to each other about something other than men. 

Sounds simple right? Well of the top 25 grossing movies of 2016 only half passed the test. 

I don’t know how 12.5 movies passed the test. Maybe one of them was a short film :).
