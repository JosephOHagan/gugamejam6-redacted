Bashkiriya covers a large contiguous forest and network of dissected river valleys on the southern end of the Ural mountains. The park is a buffer between the industrialized flat lands to the west, and the mountainous and sparsely-populated Shulgan-Tash Nature Reserve and Allyn-Solok ("Golden Bee Tree") entomological reserve to the east.
