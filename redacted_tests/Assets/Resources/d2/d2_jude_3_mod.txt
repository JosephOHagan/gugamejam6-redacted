There’s this thing called “hope” but hope’s just a word
That maybe you said or maybe you heard
But that’s what you need and you need it bad
In this world gone wrong, in this world gone mad
But where do you find it this hope that’s out there
Out on the road, out there somewhere
Some find it in God and others in man
Some find it in love, do you understand?
I can’t tell you where, that’s all up to you
But look and you’ll find it, that’s certainly true
Maybe I’m right or wrong, it’s just my opinion
As far as I’m concerned hope’s a mighty fine companion
